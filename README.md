# Syn Documentation

This is the Main repository for **Syn Wiki Center** _Tutorials_ and _API Documentation_

### Offical Launch Date

This new **Syn Wiki Center** will be officially available on or before _19th of September 2016_ under the URL [Wiki.Syn.co.in](http://wiki.syn.co.in)


### Work in Progress

> This is a work in progress, we will soon be making a transition from the WordPress based **Syn Wiki Center** to Markdown based automated library documentation along with custom _Tutorials_

### Improving the Docs

If you find any mistake in our Tutorials section or feel something can be improved, please do feel free to notify us and we will take the necessary actions on your behalf.

Our goal is to give all our developrs a unifying experience and that is one of the reasons we are now bringing everything under the shelter of **Syn Wiki Center**
